# Findings register (Tier 2)

> Durable, session-discovered knowledge: gotchas, working commands,
> conventions, stuck-patterns. **Scan before debugging or running non-obvious
> commands.** Promote to CLAUDE.md §9 once a finding recurs or is endorsed.
> Format: `- [YYYY-MM-DD] finding — evidence/command`.

- [2026-07-24] Example set is **2 PDF + 1 EPUB, no MOBI** despite "pdf or mobi"
  in the brief — MOBI support goes through `ebook-convert` with a converted
  fixture for tests.
- [2026-07-24] Both example PDFs have text layers (no OCR pass needed), but
  *This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends* is OCR-sourced: running headers and
  roman page numbers appear inline in extracted text (`"PROLOGUE \nXix \n"`).
  Normalizer must strip header/footer lines by repeating-pattern detection, not
  just regex.
- [2026-07-24] Environment (TensorForgeX): Python 3.10.12, Node v22.13.1,
  PyMuPDF 1.27.2 installed system-wide, `pdftotext` and Calibre
  `ebook-convert` on PATH.
- [2026-07-24] `data/` is gitignored and holds copyrighted books — never
  commit, never upload contents anywhere except segment batches to the
  configured LLM API during translation.
